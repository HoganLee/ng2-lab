# Angular 2 Playground

> As Pawel describes in the original [ng2-play](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play) repo, this is a minimal ES6 project using Angular 2.

Besides things like the new [router](https://github.com/angular/router) and [components](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/annotations/Directive-class.html) in Angular 2, ES6 usage with [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) are also being illustrated.
